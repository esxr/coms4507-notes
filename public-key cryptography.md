- If someone needs to send data, they use **your public key to encrypt**
- You then use your private key to decrypt

___
### Problems
- Data tampering **"Digital Identity faking"**
	- Solution: [[Digital Signature]]
- Impersonation **"Real Identity Faking"**
	- Charlie creates his own public key and private key, 
	- Charlie claims he is Alice and send his public key to Bob. 
	- Bob will be able to communicate with Charlie, but Bob will think that he is sending his data to Alice.

___
### Algorithms
- [[RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman) Algorithm]] 
	- Create a **mathematically linked** pair of keys
