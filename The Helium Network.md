[[The Helium Network.pdf]]

___
- [ ] **Explain flaw in current implementation**

- [ ] **Explain aim of new technology**
- open source blockchain network
- deploy ioT devices and build global wireless network
- integrate with iot

- [ ] **Key features of new technology**


- [ ] **Explain concept behind new technology**



- [ ] **Explain implementation of new technology**

**network**
- LoRaWAN - low power WAN
- Build on top of the LoRa radio modulation technique
- Use for the unlicensed ISM radio bands for network deployments

**tokens** (HNT)
- use **Burn and Mint Equilibrium**
	- HNT is earned when hotspots:
		• Provide and validate wireless coverage 
		• Transfer device date over the network
	
	- HNT is burned when:
		- Devices use the network

**consensus**
![[Pasted image 20220618055951.png|400]]
- proof-of-coverage - proof that hotspot is working properly
	- challenger - tries to prove that the wireless coverage is real
	- transmitter (beacon) - sends commands to hotspots and verifies
	- witness - monitor and report on poc activity
- consensus group is elected by the system


- [ ] **List all solutions based on new technology**
- LongFi - LongFi is a technology that mounts the traditional LoRaWAN wireless protocol to the Helium network
- Console - Console is a web-based data management tool

- [ ] **Advantages of new technology**

- [ ] **Limitations/Disadvantages of new technology**
- what happens when `mint < burn`?
	- recycle a pool of burned HNT
